Create a Python-based web service with the following specifications:

1. Set up a Flask application to handle API requests.

2. Implement two main API endpoints:
   a. '/merge_audio' - Merges multiple audio files into a single audio file.
   b. '/merge_audio_video' - Merges an audio file with a video file.

3. Use FFmpeg for audio and video processing. Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible.

4. For the '/merge_audio' endpoint:
   - Accept multiple audio files as input.
   - Use FFmpeg to concatenate the audio files.
   - Return the merged audio file as a response.

5. For the '/merge_audio_video' endpoint:
   - Accept one audio file and one video file as input.
   - Use FFmpeg to merge the audio with the video.
   - Return the resulting video file with the merged audio as a response.

6. Implement error handling for file uploads, processing errors, and invalid requests.

7. Use appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses for success and error cases.

8. Ensure the API can be easily called from Airtable or other external services.

9. Include comments and docstrings for clear code documentation.

10. Implement logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

11. Use a configuration file or environment variables for any settings (e.g., file storage locations, FFmpeg path).

12. Consider implementing a simple rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse.

13. Add a basic authentication mechanism to secure the API endpoints.

Here's a skeleton structure to get started:

import os
from flask import Flask, request, send_file, jsonify
import subprocess
import uuid
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Configuration
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
OUTPUT_FOLDER = 'output'
ALLOWED_AUDIO_EXTENSIONS = {'mp3', 'wav', 'ogg'}
ALLOWED_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS = {'mp4', 'avi', 'mov'}

# Helper functions
def allowed_file(filename, allowed_extensions):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in allowed_extensions

def merge_audio_files(input_files, output_file):
    # Implement FFmpeg command to merge audio files
    pass

def merge_audio_with_video(audio_file, video_file, output_file):
    # Implement FFmpeg command to merge audio with video
    pass

@app.route('/merge_audio', methods=['POST'])
def merge_audio():
    # Implement logic for merging multiple audio files
    pass

@app.route('/merge_audio_video', methods=['POST'])
def merge_audio_video():
    # Implement logic for merging audio with video
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Please implement the full functionality based on this structure, ensuring all requirements are met.
